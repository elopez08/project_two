    This is an attempt to make a new project with the branches that we're adding in the system.  I've made the bare skeleton for the HTML format as well as added at the comment on what we're adding in the body.  Follow each comment to see what is being added:

    On the overall structure, we need to make the following:

    1. A section involving a title:  Lernantino.  It has on the side of the tab:  About Me, Work, Contact Me, and Resume.  All of them have a teal underline border on each.  The Lernantino is a H1 with a Dark grey font and has a teal background.  On that same line, we have an overall dark grey color matching the letters in Lernantino.
    2. A section involving a blue strip image with on the lower left having a "Cool Subtitle Here!".  This one has the same format as Lernantino.
    3. A side section that has About Me, Work, Contact Me.  All will link to the target when clicked from the top
    4. 
    5. 
    6. A "Work" section that has the following:
        *Surf Report
        *LED Wall
        *Calculator
        *Patzel Puzzles
        *Run Buddy at the last section

        During this section, the Surf Report is the giant one.  LED wall and Calculator are on the same line.  Patzel Puzzles and the Run Buddy form are in the same line
    7. A Footer that contains a "Contact Info" with the tabs of: Phone Number, Email, Github, Twitter, and Spotify

    8.  Have "About Me", "Work", and "Contact Info on the side on their respective sections with a border line on it.  This line goes at the top of the text all the way to the bottom of the section.
