                1. The a href is a command that issues a link to a site
                2. The ones inside the quotation "" is the name of the site
                3. The target= is a command that is issued on the link while _blank is what allows it to make a new tab browser
                4. After closing it with the bracket, you can put in a name, which is then clickable for the hyperlink-->
